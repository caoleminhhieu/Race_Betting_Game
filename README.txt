Hi guys,

This Race Betting Game is a game written by Python (using only Pygame).

If you are beginer in Python, you should watch "Pygame tutorials sentdex" before blending into my code.

This tutorials are extremely basic, so you can learn and make your own game easily. (just like me :3 )

All my sources (images) from Internet I write them at first lines in source code, so you can
check them out and replace what you want.

My source code contains a lot of functions to solve game's features such as:
	+)leader_board() function to show Top 3 highscores in history when you click on button LEADERBOARD at start menu interface.
	+)input_and_map() function which contains several functions (input_numplayer(), input_name(), choose_racer())
	  to input infomation from players.	
	+)I write comments thorough my code so you can get better understand them, if my comments are bad, you can contact me by gmail (at the end)

And I think the main difficulty in my code is find out the way I used lists, matrices for conecting functions, storing players's information, and conditions to call functions.
Everything that users input or click (for typing name, choosing racer or maps) will call the respective function, and almost functions include WHILE LOOP, so I used some lists to create
conditions to make sure the functions be called correctly. Moreover, lists are also to store images for character's animation, to rotate characters, etc...

When I made this game, my English is not good and I was a beginger in Python, you maybe get stuck. Therefore, plz contact me by gmail:

If my code is too bad to understand, you can just try and enjoy my game :)

Thanks for reading till the end! <3
